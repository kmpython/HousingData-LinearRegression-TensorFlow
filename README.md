# HousingData-LinearRegression-TensorFlow

The overall aim of this project for me was to get introduced to TensorFlow.

I became accquinted with many basic concepts like using variables, placeholders, epochs, steps etc
and made my first model using TensorFlow

The overall accuracy of the model is very poor but we can improve it by adding more steps and layers. I am however, limited by the processing power of my old laptop.
Despite the low accuracy this was a good exercise for me as I learned a lot about using tensorflow.
